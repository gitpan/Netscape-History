		Netscape History Modules Distribution
				v1.000

This distribution contains two modules which can be used to access
the history database which is maintained by the Netscape Navigator
browser, aka Mozilla. The modules are:

    Netscape::History
	object class for accessing the history database.

    Netscape::HistoryURL
	object class which acts like URI::URL, but also holds the
	time of your last visit.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make install

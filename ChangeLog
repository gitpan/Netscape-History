			ChangeLog for Netscape History modules

1.002 neilb 15-Feb-1997

	The constructor now takes an optional argument: the full path for
	the Netscape history database. If not specified, then it will
	default to $HOME/.netscape/history.db. Suggested by Greg Paris.

	Removed %OVERLOAD from the use vars qw() line in HistoryURL.pm


1.001 neilb 30-Jan-1997

	We were using the deprecated %OVERLOAD mechanism, which no longer
	works with the most recent releases of Perl. Changed to use the
	new mechanism, "use overload ...".


1.000 neilb

	First version

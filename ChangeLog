			ChangeLog for Netscape History modules


2.00 rit + neilb 04-Sep-1997

	The format of the database has changed - more information is stored
	for each URL. Updated both modules to provide access to the new
	info. The old method (visit_time()) is supported for backwards
	compatibility.

	You have to set $Netscape::History::NETSCAPE_VERSION to the
	major version of the Netscape you're running, so that the modules
	know how to interpret the history database entries.


1.002 neilb 15-Feb-1997

	The constructor now takes an optional argument: the full path for
	the Netscape history database. If not specified, then it will
	default to $HOME/.netscape/history.db. Suggested by Greg Paris.

	Removed %OVERLOAD from the use vars qw() line in HistoryURL.pm


1.001 neilb 30-Jan-1997

	We were using the deprecated %OVERLOAD mechanism, which no longer
	works with the most recent releases of Perl. Changed to use the
	new mechanism, "use overload ...".

			ChangeLog for Netscape History modules

3.00 neilb 2-august-1999

	Folded in patch from Andreas Koenig <andreas.koenig@anima.de>,
	which enables Netscape::History to work with Berkeley DB 2.

	Removed the use vars for NETSCAPE_HISTORY. Trying to set it
	will now result in a warning, assuming you're use'ing strict.

	Switched to the VERSION hack to use the cvs Revision for
	module version numbers. The VERSION of Netscape::History
	is used as the distribution version.

	Bumped revision up to 3.00, the change to work with DB 2
	would seem to warrant this.

2.02 neilb 08-may-1998

	Added a get_url() method to the Netscape::History module:
	      $NHurl = $history->get_url( URL );
	This was suggested by Dave Steiner <steiner@bakerst.rutgers.edu>.
	Added a test-case to the test-suite.

	Small tidy up to the documentation for the next_url() method,
	which had a description based on an older version.

2.01 neilb 22-mar-1998

	Removed the need for the NETSCAPE_VERSION variable kludge.
	Jimmy Aitken <jimmy@pyramid.com> pointed out that we can
	just check the size of the data under each key, and determine
	perl-URL whether it is using the pre-v4 or post-v4 format.

	Added an add_url() method to Netscape::History, which can take
	either a Netscape::HistoryURL, or a text URL (URI::URL as well).
	This was suggested by Jarkko Hietaniemi
	<jarkko.hietaniemi@research.nokia.com>.

	Added a testsuite

2.00 rit + neilb 04-Sep-1997

	The format of the database has changed - more information is stored
	for each URL. Updated both modules to provide access to the new
	info. The old method (visit_time()) is supported for backwards
	compatibility.

	You have to set $Netscape::History::NETSCAPE_VERSION to the
	major version of the Netscape you're running, so that the modules
	know how to interpret the history database entries.


1.002 neilb 15-Feb-1997

	The constructor now takes an optional argument: the full path for
	the Netscape history database. If not specified, then it will
	default to $HOME/.netscape/history.db. Suggested by Greg Paris.

	Removed %OVERLOAD from the use vars qw() line in HistoryURL.pm


1.001 neilb 30-Jan-1997

	We were using the deprecated %OVERLOAD mechanism, which no longer
	works with the most recent releases of Perl. Changed to use the
	new mechanism, "use overload ...".


1.000 neilb

	First version
